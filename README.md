## This is my project for the MERN stack application; my own Blog!

netlify link: https://vm-mernstack-project.netlify.app/

# I steadily worked on and developed this project by using both the tools and knowledge I've gained through the PerScholas Software Engineering course, as well as utilizing various other educational materials such as StackOverflow, YouTube, codecademy, etc.

# The project itself utilizies various dependencies, such as Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express.js, and React.js.

# Within the blog exists a functional CRUD model in the form of creating, updating, gathering, and deleting any blog posts.

# Furthermore, the blog contains an authentication package which allows any visitors to create their own logins, and make their own posts!

 The blog features extensive routing and logic used to handle a multitude of callback functions to allow full utilization of the backend api.

##MVP

#The develop app is able to register and login users with hashed passwords, create, update, delete posts, and make Random Advice API calls!


##SWOT

#The build is not fully finished- images do not properly process and some styling still needs to be done to make it look better and more polished


##POST-MVP

#I plan to completely finish the website, as it will definitely be going onto my portfolio as an example of the progress I have made throughout my journey of Software Engineering.
